# Commit

## Definition
* Captures a snapshot of the project’s currently staged changes [1]
* “git add” precedes the commit, where “git add” puts any potential commits in the staging area
* How to make commits:
    * “git commit” --> Commits the staged snapshot
    * “git commit -a” --> Commits a snapshot of all changes in working directory to only tracked files with modifications
    * “git commit -m “Example message”” --> Commits the staged snapshot with a message
